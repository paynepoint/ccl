Bigelow Laboratory

Nick Record — Senior Research Scientist, Tandy Center for Ocean Forecasting Director

Email: nrecord@bigelow.org | Phone: (207) 315-2567 ext 316
Focus: Ocean forecasting, computational oceanography, ecosystem modeling, AI/machine learning applications
Perfect match for your data visualization/software architecture skills



GMRI (Gulf of Maine Research Institute)

Kathy Mills, Ph.D. — Senior Scientist, leads Integrated Systems Ecology Lab

Email: kmills@gmri.org | Phone: (207) 228-1657

She's literally turning complex ocean data into actionable insights for fishing communities



Island Institute

Contact via main office: PO Box 648, Rockland, ME 04841
Susie Arnold, Ph.D. — Senior Ocean Scientist (mentioned in recent events)
Main switchboard should be able to connect you to their climate/data team
Focus: Marine economy, climate solutions for coastal communities, working waterfront preservation

University of Maine

Sean Birkel, Ph.D. — Maine State Climatologist, Climate Change Institute

Focus: Climate data visualization (built Climate Reanalyzer), climate modeling
Strong tech/coding background, exactly your intersection



Why These Matter to You
Nick Record at Bigelow is your strongest lead — he's already doing AI and ocean forecasting work, has community science initiatives with eDNA data collection, and explicitly works at the intersection of computational work and social science. Your software architecture + AI skills could directly support the Tandy Center's forecasting systems.
Kathy Mills deals with translating complex ecological data for stakeholders — classic visualization challenge where your enterprise architecture background could help build better decision-support tools.
Sean Birkel has built Climate Reanalyzer essentially solo (with student help) — he could absolutely use someone with your architecture skills to scale that infrastructure.
Your Pitch Angle
Lead with: "I'm a software architect transitioning to marine climate work through UNE's program, with specific experience in AI implementation and data visualization systems. I'm looking to apply these skills to oceanographic data challenges." Then ask about their current data pipeline bottlenecks or visualization needs.Claude is AI and can make mistakes.
